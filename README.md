Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with npx-create-React-App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

1. **MovieList Component with Infinite Scrolling**: I successfully implemented the MovieList component using React and JavaScript, incorporating infinite scrolling functionality. This demonstrates my strong understanding of front-end development and user experience, allowing users to seamlessly explore a large number of movies without page reloads.

2. **Design with SCSS**: I effectively utilized SCSS to design the MovieList component, showcasing my proficiency in CSS preprocessors. The clean and visually appealing design of the component enhances the overall user interface and reflects my design skills.

3. **Thunks for Asynchronous Calls**: I skillfully integrated Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous API calls. This choice highlights my expertise in state management and demonstrates my ability to manage complex data flows within a React application, resulting in smooth and efficient data retrieval.

4. **MovieCard Component Creation**: I successfully developed the MovieCard component using ReactJS, indicating my strong grasp of component-based architecture. The MovieCard's modular structure and reusability showcase my proficiency in creating encapsulated and easily maintainable components.

In summary, my accomplishments in creating the MovieList component with infinite scrolling, designing it using SCSS, employing Redux Thunk for asynchronous operations, and crafting the MovieCard component collectively exemplify my proficiency in front-end development, state management, design, and component-based architecture.

If I had an additional four hours to enhance my solution, I would focus on the following improvements:

1. **Enhanced Design and Responsiveness**: I would invest more time in refining the design of the components, ensuring a polished and visually engaging user interface. Additionally, I would work on optimizing the responsiveness of the application, making sure it looks and works well across various devices and screen sizes. This would improve the overall user experience and contribute to a professional and user-friendly application.

2. **Component Reusability and Modularity**: To enhance maintainability and reusability, I would further break down the existing components into smaller, more focused components. This approach would promote modularity and allow for easier management of different parts of the application. By creating reusable components, I could save development time in the future and ensure a consistent design and behavior across the application.

3. **Refinement of Functionality**: I would conduct a thorough review of the existing functionality to identify any potential areas for improvement. This could involve refining the user interaction flows, optimizing API calls, and addressing any potential performance bottlenecks. These small checks would result in a smoother and more efficient user experience.

4. **Additional Features or Enhancements**: With extra time, I might consider adding supplementary features to enrich the application's value. This could include implementing sorting or filtering options for movie lists, integrating user authentication for personalized experiences, or incorporating a search functionality to find specific movies. These enhancements would elevate the application's utility and user engagement.

In summary, dedicating the additional four hours to improving the design, responsiveness, component reusability, functionality refinement, and potential feature enhancements would result in a more polished, user-friendly, and versatile application that aligns even better with user expectations and industry standards.
